## Alphametrics / Cryptarithms 

A cryptarithmetic puzzle is a mathematical exercise where the digits of some 
numbers are represented by letters (or symbols) in which each letter represents 
a unique digit. The goal is to find the digits such that a given mathemetical
equation is verified. They are also known as Alphametrics, especially in German.

For example

> SEND + MORE = MONEY
> 
> 9567 + 1085 = 10652
